# Sorting
Sorting is a fundamental algorithm design problem. Many efficient algorithms
use sorting as a subroutine, because it is often easier to process data if the
elements are in a sorted order.
For example, the problem ”does an array contain two equal elements?” is easy
to solve using sorting. If the array contains two equal elements, they will be next
to each other after sorting, so it is easy to find them. Also, the problem ”what is
the most frequent element in an array?” can be solved similarly.
There are many algorithms for sorting, and they are also good examples of
how to apply different algorithm design techniques. The efficient general sorting
algorithms work in O(nlogn) time, and many algorithms that use sorting as a
subroutine also have this time complexity.
# Sorting theory
The basic problem in sorting is as follows:
#
Given an array that contains n elements, your task is to sort the elements in
increasing order.
